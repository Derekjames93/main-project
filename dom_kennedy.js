                        Hop over the fence, ain't no tripping cuz they know me
                        This is what it's like when you graduate to OG
                        
                        Time keep moving like a record spinning
                        Step up out the house and I'm representing
                        I don't just live here, shit, I represent it
                        That Westside got your girlfriend catching feelings
                        Don't ask about my last name, it's presidential
                        You can't talk about a street that you ain't never been to
                        You always yapping bout them girls you ain't never been through
                        She call my phone crying, I give her more than tissue
                        A chance to make a million off these instrumentals
                        And I deserve the whole thing, look at what we been through
                        If it was over today, I ain't got no issues
                        I'll be right back in Leimert to keep it funky with you
                        
                        You better off dead than chilling with the feds
                        You tell on somebody here, they gone cut yo head
                        Ask me for advice niggas, don't be dumb and scared
                        The school of hard knocks, don't be unprepared
                        Soon as you hit junior high, it feel like no one cares
                        Opportunity might knock, but it'll be no one there
                        Them boys waiting at the park, but don't you go in there
                        Them gang injunctions hitting niggas with over 40 years
                        SWV show, these niggas throwing chairs
                        That's the type of shit I seen out here
                        A helicopter every night, can't dream out here
                        Damn, it feel good to say I did my thing out here, I be
                        
                        I learned the whole game from the ones that lived it
                        I was around black men who was running businesses
                        Making something out of nothing, shit we all physicists
                        And they tried to buy me out, but we wasn't interested
                        Y'all do something good and it's so interesting
                        We do something better and niggas gone mention it
                        It really don't matter cuz y'all got no benjamins
                        Remember back in 98, you was so feminine
                        Now it's a rag in yo pocket, nigga who you mimicking
                        You gotta pay yo dues first, no dividends
                        No matter if it's Chucks or some old Timberlands
                        Sometimes I close my eyes and I start remembering`
